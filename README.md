Some notes written during watching the ["Learn Flutter"](https://www.udemy.com/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/) course

## Getting started with Flutter

[documentation](https://flutter.io/).

## About widgets

Everything is a widget in flutter. A widget may render UI or may contain only some logic. A flutter application is a Widget tree.

## Some notes

- Private classes are named with underscore in the beginning
- Flutter always calls 'build' when draws something on the screen the build always returns another widget
